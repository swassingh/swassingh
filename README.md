### 🚀 Featured Projects

#### 🔍 Hadoop Search
**Goal:** Develop a semantic search and recommendation engine for Apache Hadoop documentation.  
**Stack:** Python · FastAPI · FAISS · BM25 · LangChain  
**My Role:** Designed and implemented the document retrieval pipeline — embedding text chunks, indexing with FAISS, and integrating BM25 for hybrid search. Also optimized query latency and accuracy using evaluation metrics (ROUGE & cosine similarity).  
**Impact:** Reduced documentation lookup time by ~40%, helping developers locate relevant Hadoop content faster.

#### 🛡️ LLMGuard
**Goal:** Detect and explain security vulnerabilities in GitHub repositories using LLMs.  
**Stack:** Qwen-3 · LangChain · JSON Reporting · GitHub Actions  
**My Role:** Built the core vulnerability-detection logic and evaluation pipeline. Designed the rule-based classification schema, integrated LLM outputs into structured JSON reports, and automated repository analysis via GitHub Actions.  
**Impact:** Enabled developers to automatically identify prompt injection and insecure code patterns in LLM-based applications.

#### 🧬 DubsTech Datathon 2025 – DataMed  
**Goal:** Predict hospital readmission risks from anonymized healthcare datasets.  
**Stack:** XGBoost · Scikit-learn · Pandas · Streamlit  
**My Role:** Led the ML modeling pipeline — engineered key features (e.g., comorbidity index, prior stay length), tuned XGBoost hyperparameters, and built a live Streamlit dashboard for model explainability (SHAP visualizations).  
**Result:** Placed **3rd globally for Best ML Model** (6th Annual DubsTech Datathon).
